# TouchTouch

#### Abstract:
Android & Physical Computing Project for Art Hackerthon: Robot and Drone<br>
Using Bluetooth 4.0, Blueinno board and Android application are connected. Handmade strain sensor is attached to the board so that it can transmit its value to the Android application. Simple algorithm is implemented to distinguish the patterns of touch which is inspired from FSM (Finite State Machine). Three types of pattern are implemented - Single touch, Multiple Touch, Long Touch. These different types of touch result in different reactions from application and user can also change the reactions via few settings in application - sound effect, score per touch, etc.
